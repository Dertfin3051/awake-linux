# Awake
*For Linux by dertfin1 | v1.0*

Awake is a simple program that allows you to disable sleep mode on your computer*

## How it works?

Every 3 minutes, your mouse pointer will move 1 pixel and back, which will create "mouse activity" and prevent the computer from going to sleep.

## Installation

For correct installation you must have `curl` installed.

Installation occurs automatically after entering this command:
```bash
sudo wget -O - "" | bash
```
