# Awake
*For Linux by dertfin1 | v1.2*

Awake is a simple program that allows you to disable sleep mode on your computer*

## How it works?

Every 3 minutes, your mouse pointer will move 1 pixel and back, which will create "mouse activity" and prevent the computer from going to sleep.

## Installation

For correct installation you must have `curl` installed.

Installation occurs automatically after entering this command:
```bash
sudo wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dertfin3051/awake-linux/remote-install/install.sh" | bash
```

# How to run

After installation, restart your terminal and enter this command:
```bash
awake
```

__As long as your terminal is open__, the computer will not go into sleep mode.
